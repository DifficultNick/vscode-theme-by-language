# Theme by language

Themes are great but sometimes some are better than others for a certain language.

This extension lets you select which theme to apply by language.

If you prefer, like me, to edit Markdown and AsciiDoc files using a dark theme but code using a light theme, or prefer the coloration of a theme for a specific language, this extension is made for you.

Several commands are at your disposal to select the theme to use for the current file language (with a preview).
Check out the commands and configuration in the Extensions panel > Theme by language > Contributions.

> **Note**: If you have set a theme for a language, changing the color theme using the standard vscode menu will not work. To change the default theme, use the `Set default theme` command.

## Preview

## How to use

1. Install the extension
2. Open a file and use the command `Set theme for current file language` to set the theme to use for this file language

## Limitations

- Changing the language manually for the current file will not automatically change the theme. You will need to switch editors.
- Does not work well when switching between multiple instances of vscode
